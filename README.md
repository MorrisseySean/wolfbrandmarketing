## Digital Marketing Solutions

Want to get your business ahead on the online marketplace? From making sure you show up on your favorite search engine, to well constructed social media posts and adverts, it can be a struggle to keep up with the day to day trends of the Internet. That's where Wolfbrand Marketing can help you.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/MorrisseySean/wolfbrandmarketing/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
